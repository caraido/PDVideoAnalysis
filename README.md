# PDVideoAnalysis

**A Machine Learning Pipeline with Computer-Vision Methods for Quantifying Standardized Motor Assessment in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease**

This repository contains code and resources for using computer vision and machine learning to analyze standardized motor tasks in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). The project was developed as a research project at Northwestern University and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, and is summarized in the accompanying [poster](./poster.pdf).

## ðŸš€ Overview

Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor function. Clinical motor assessments, such as the **MDS-UPDRS**, are time-consuming, infrequent, and require in-person visits.  

**Goal:**  
Develop a video-based pipeline to automatically predict standardized motor assessment scores for PD patients, assisting clinicians with more efficient and accessible monitoring.

## ðŸ“‹ Methodology

The pipeline consists of:

1. **Video Processing** â€“ Segment and preprocess raw video.
2. **Pose Estimation** â€“ Extract 2D/3D body keypoints using mesh regression.
3. **Kinematic Calculation** â€“ Compute joint angles, speeds, accelerations, and body swing measures.
4. **Post-Processing** â€“ Temporal smoothing and noise reduction.
5. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Derive clinically relevant features (e.g., tremor frequency, step frequency, elbow angular velocity).
6. **Label Encoding** â€“ Convert clinical scores into ordinal categories.
7. **Supervised Learning** â€“ Train machine learning models (e.g., Ordinal Random Forest) for prediction.
